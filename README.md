- Working Directory: your local file storage system.
- Repository: includes stage and branches, you add local file to stage (git add filename) from your working directory, then commit it to the branch (master or other branches, git commit -m "message"). HEAD is the current version of the branch.
- Remote Repository: A server that acts as a back-up of your local repository. You can clone a remote repository to your local computer (git clone ...) or push some local changes to your remote repository (git push). Generally speaking, we use GitHub as our remote repository.
